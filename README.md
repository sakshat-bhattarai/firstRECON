# firstRECON - Web Application for Reconnaissance

## Overview  
**firstRECON** is an essential web application designed for individuals interested in **network defense, security posture assessment**, or **educational purposes**. This application integrates **Ping, DNS Lookup**, and **advanced port scanning** features, allowing users to identify potential vulnerabilities and possible exploits of a targeted host.

Developing a web application necessitates significant time and effort. To integrate the required functionalities, extensive research was conducted on existing approaches. Additionally, a **Gantt chart** and a **work breakdown structure** were created to ensure timely completion of tasks.

Proper web application design was performed from scratch to ensure functionality. This included defining the **feature-wise flowchart, sequence diagram, and communication diagram**. Extensive research was carried out to identify the best methodologies, analyzing their advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the **Agile Extreme Programming** approach was adopted to ensure efficient development, accompanied by **comprehensive documentation**.
