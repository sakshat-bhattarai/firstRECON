“firstRECON” an essential web application which can be used by the person who are inclined towards the defending network, checking security posture status of intended target or for an educational purpose. The firstRECON is embedded with Ping, DNS Lookup along with the advance port scanning feature which can determine potential vulnerability expose of the targeted host along with its exploit.  Developing a web application necessitates a significant amount of time and effort. To include the needed functionalities into the application, research on proper research on the existing approaches was conducted. Similarly, a Gantt chart and a work breakdown structure were constructed in order to fulfil the required task within the time frame. Proper designing of the web application was performed from the scratch to make it functional, for determining the appropriate path of the web application according to the feature wise flowchart, sequence diagram, communication diagram then, in order to determine the best approach for the project, continuous was research was conducted on numerous methodologies, as well as their benefits and drawbacks. Finally, the Agile's Extreme Programming approach was employed and all the works were conducted accordingly to while developing this project with proper documentation.
